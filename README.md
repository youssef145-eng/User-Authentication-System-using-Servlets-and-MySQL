Technologies Used:
Java Servlets (J2EE)
MySQL Database
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for frontend)
Tomcat or any other servlet container
Project Features:
User Registration (Sign Up):
New users can register by providing a username, email, and password.
Passwords are hashed before storing in the database for security.
Email validation ensures unique user registration.
User Login:
Users can log in using their registered email and password.
Credentials are verified against the database.
Session management is implemented to maintain user authentication status.
Session Management:
Secure user sessions ensure that only logged-in users can access restricted pages.
Session timeout handling for security.
Database Integration:
MySQL is used to store user credentials securely.
Proper use of prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
Logout Feature:
Users can log out, which invalidates their session and redirects them to the login page.
Error Handling & Validation:
Proper error messages for incorrect login credentials.
Frontend and backend validation for form fields.
How It Works:
The user navigates to the login/signup page.
On signup, the entered credentials are validated and stored in the MySQL database.
On login, the system checks the credentials and starts a session if valid.
The user is redirected to the protected section of the website.
If the user logs out, the session is terminated, and they are redirected to the login page.
Installation & Setup:
Install and configure MySQL Server.
Create a database and a users table with fields (id, name, email, password).
Configure the database connection in the servlet (JDBC URL, username, password).
Deploy the application on a Tomcat server.
Access the login/signup page and test the authentication system.
Future Enhancements:
Implement password recovery/reset functionality.
Add role-based authentication (Admin/User access levels).
Implement OAuth or JWT-based authentication for enhanced security.
Improve UI/UX with modern frameworks like Bootstrap or React.
This project serves as a fundamental implementation of user authentication using Java Servlets and MySQL, providing a strong foundation for building secure web applications.
